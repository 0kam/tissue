A Time-series Image Segmentation tool with Semi-Unsupervised Encoders.

Using Gaussian Mixture Variational Recursive Neural Networks, I implemented a simple image segmentation tool for time-lapse cameras that captures the seasonal changes of landscapes, e.g. [NIES' monitoring project in Japanese alpine area](https://db.cger.nies.go.jp/gem/ja/mountain/station.html?id=2).
